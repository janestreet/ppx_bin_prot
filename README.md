ppx_bin_prot
============

Generation of binary serialization and deserialization functions from type definitions.
There's more information about:

- The [bin-prot format](https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot/blob/master/README.md) 
- [bin-prot-shape](https://github.com/janestreet/bin_prot/blob/master/shape/README.md), which is useful for checking
  compatibility of the `bin_prot` representations of different types.
